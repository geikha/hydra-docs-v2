# video synth basics

## Modularity

Hydra is inspired by [modular synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer).
Instead of connecting modules with cables you connect different kinds of JavaScript functions using dots and calls. Numeric arguments inside functions are analogue to the position of knobs in modules.

The logic is to start with a ***source*** (such as `osc()`, `shape()`, or `noise()`), and then add transformations to ***geometry*** and ***color*** (such as `.rotate()`, `.kaleid()`, `.pixelate()` ), and in the end always connect the chain of transformations to the output screen `.out()` .

For example, the following code renders an oscillator with parameters frequency, sync, and RGB offset:
```hydra
osc(5, -0.126, 0.514).out()
```

We can add another transformation to the oscillator from above, by adding the function `rotate()` after the oscillator:
```hydra
osc(5,-0.126,0.514).rotate().out()
```

We can expand the patch, pixelating the output of the above function:
```hydra
osc(5,-0.126,0.514).rotate().pixelate().out()
```
